Project proposal slides 4/8: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1WaRgAbuTzISzE_IZ6SV-jtd89hGjRGK5qTM_1wsBIZQ/edit?usp=sharing

Things to do:

*Timer - Done
*Preventing illegal moves - Done
*Last Move Indicator - Done
*Pawn Promotion - Done
*AI Bot - Done

note: Seems like there is a certain edge case: Bug appears rarely, possibly related to last move indicator in 2 player. Single player operates fine---Possibly correlated with check and checkmate conditions. Also, sometimes interfers with white pawn first move. black can move 2 boxes on first move, white can only move one in certain scenarios.
