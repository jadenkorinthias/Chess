We already have a mostly functioning chest game with movement and check/checkmate.
We would like to add sound effects everywhere: taking peices/ peice movement/end game.
Additonaly we would like to prevent illegal moves. ex. moving a king that remains in check after move
Castling needs to be added.
We would like to add one player using randomization, but we will see what we can do. OR *Lichess API Bot
We want to have a functioning timer that counts down and saves for both.
We want to add En passant move as well.
Lastly we want to add a player log
